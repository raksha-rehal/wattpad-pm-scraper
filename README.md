# wattpad-pm-scraper
A way for users to obtain records of their Wattpad private message logs. Logs are saved in the "saved_logs" folder as .txt files.

## how to use
1 - Select the "Code" button and then "Download ZIP".
2 - Extract the .zip file to any location you prefer.
3 - Run the "main.exe" file.
4 - Fill out the authentication fields + the usernames whose PMs you wish to retrieve and click submit.
5 - Done! :)

## tips
1 - Double-check the usernames that you input for spelling errors.
2 - It is best to input all the usernames in one-go, or split them up (depending on how many PMs you have). Avoid duplicating PMs you have already saved, as this will save all the messages in the same file twice.
2 - If you make a duplication, you can click the "Delete Current Saved Logs" button and retry!

## file contents
`main.exe` The executable file to be ran by the user.
`.gitattributes` A pointer to all .exe files.
`main.py` The Python code associated with the .exe. Not to be ran; if it is, dependencies are to be installed for best utilization.
`saved_logs` An empty folder to save PMs as .txt files into.
